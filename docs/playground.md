# Playground

The playground app lives in `playgrounds/` and consumes `@bunnix/components` directly.

Entry points:

- `playgrounds/src/index.mjs` imports `@bunnix/components/styles.css`
- `playgrounds/src/app.mjs` uses components from the package

Use it to validate new components and design changes before release.
