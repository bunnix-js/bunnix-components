# ✨ Feature Request: [Your Feature Title Here]

## Goal
Clearly describe the high-level objective of this feature. What problem does it solve, or what capability does it add?

## Problem & Scenario
Describe the current limitation or user story that this feature addresses. Provide a concrete scenario or use case where this feature would be beneficial.

```javascript
// Provide a code snippet demonstrating the problem or the desired usage pattern
// If it's a UI feature, describe the user interaction.
```

## Root Cause (if applicable)
If this feature is addressing a current limitation or a bug in existing functionality, explain the underlying reason for that behavior.

## Proposed Technical Changes
Provide a detailed description of the technical changes required to implement this feature. This should include:
-   Which files will be affected (e.g., `src/components/Button.mjs`, `src/styles/buttons.css`).
-   What changes will be made to existing functions or what new functions will be introduced.
-   Include pseudocode or snippets where helpful to illustrate the changes.

### Example: Update `src/somefile.mjs`
```javascript
// Old code snippet
const someVar = someFunc(arg1);

// New code snippet
const someVar = someNewFunc(arg1, arg2);
```

## Verification Plan
Outline how this feature will be tested. This should include:
-   **Test Cases:** Describe specific unit tests or integration tests that will be created.
-   **Expected Outcomes:** What should these tests assert?
-   Include pseudocode for test cases if appropriate.

### Test Case: [Descriptive Test Name]
```javascript
test('should verify X behavior', () => {
    // Setup (e.g., useState, render component)
    
    // Action (e.g., set state, click button)
    
    // Assertion (e.g., assert.equal, assert.deepEqual)
});
```

## Impact (if applicable)
-   Are there any breaking changes?
-   Are there any performance considerations?
-   Are there any new dependencies?
-   How does this affect existing code or patterns?
